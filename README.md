Aplicatoin for search information in a specific column

I add jar file for testing without compiling

Also I made dockerfile because I have problem with version of java on my pc

You can run it using two simple command: 

docker build . -t "airport:v1"

docker run -it airport:v1 

In addition, for both you need airports.csv in same directory where did you save jar file
